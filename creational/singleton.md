The **Singleton Pattern** is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

---

### **What is the Singleton Pattern?**

The pattern ensures:

1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is created during the application's lifetime.
2. **Global Access**: Provides a global point to access the instance.

---

### **Why Use the Singleton Pattern?**

- **Resource Management**: Useful for managing shared resources like database connections, configuration settings, or logging services.
- **Global Access**: Provides centralized control over the shared instance.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures only one instance exists even in concurrent environments.

---

### **Go Implementation**

Go doesnâ€™t have classes but supports Singleton using packages, sync mechanisms, and closures.

---

#### **Basic Singleton Example**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

type Singleton struct {
	value string
}

var instance *Singleton
var once sync.Once

func GetInstance() *Singleton {
	once.Do(func() {
		instance = &Singleton{value: "I am the singleton instance"}
	})
	return instance
}

func main() {
	// Retrieve the singleton instance
	s1 := GetInstance()
	s2 := GetInstance()

	// Confirm both are the same instance
	fmt.Println(s1 == s2) // Output: true
	fmt.Println(s1.value) // Output: I am the singleton instance
}
```

---

#### **Practical Example: Database Connection**

Imagine you need a shared database connection pool throughout the application.

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"sync"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

type Database struct {
	connection *sql.DB
}

var dbInstance *Database
var dbOnce sync.Once

func GetDatabaseInstance() *Database {
	dbOnce.Do(func() {
		connection, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/dbname")
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		dbInstance = &Database{connection: connection}
		fmt.Println("Database connection established")
	})
	return dbInstance
}

func main() {
	db1 := GetDatabaseInstance()
	db2 := GetDatabaseInstance()

	fmt.Println(db1 == db2) // Output: true
}
```

---

### **Thread Safety**

The `sync.Once` mechanism ensures that the initialization logic is executed only once, even in a concurrent environment.

---

### **Advantages**

1. **Single Instance**: Prevents the creation of multiple instances.
2. **Thread Safety**: Using `sync.Once`, the instance is thread-safe without manual locks.
3. **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when first accessed.

---

### **Disadvantages**

1. **Global State**: Makes code less modular and harder to test.
2. **Hidden Dependencies**: Can lead to tight coupling.
3. **Scalability Issues**: May create bottlenecks if the singleton is accessed frequently.

---

### **When to Use the Singleton Pattern?**

- When only one instance of a resource is required (e.g., logging, configuration).
- When managing shared resources (e.g., database connections).
- When you want controlled access to a shared resource.
