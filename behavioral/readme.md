### Behavioral design patterns

- Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify communication patterns among objects and provide solution templates for specific situations. In doing so, these patterns increase the extensibility of the interactions.

- Some of the patterns are concerned with reducing the coupling of sending and receivers, while others describe how the internal state (and any change notifications) of an object's state can be made available to other interested objects. So, as you can imagine, this is a pretty diverse bunch of patterns.
